<h2>Poems For My Muntaha 💖</h2>

<p>
Your name is a whisper in my prayer,<br>
A gentle light, forever there.<br>
In every heartbeat, soft and true,<br>
Lives endless love — only for you.
</p>

<br>

<p>
If love had a face, it would be yours.<br>
If hearts had a home, it would be where you are.<br>
In this lifetime and all above,<br>
You are my forever love.
</p>
